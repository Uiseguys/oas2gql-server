# OAS to GraphQL

This is an attempt for an [Open API Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) to [GraphQL](http://graphql.org) converter.
Everything is highly experimental and rather fragile.

## Relay spec - what needs to be implemented 

* cursor based pagination

* connections based on edges and nodes

* aggregation (i.e. count objects in a colection)

* add mutations

* roles and permissions

* authentication/security



A sample graphql-relay implementation can be found on the official page
